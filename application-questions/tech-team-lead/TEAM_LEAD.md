# Tech Team Lead Application
For your application, it is highly recommended that you comment your code as
clearly as possible. Make sure to remember important software engineering
principles:
* Methods less than 15 lines of code
* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself!)
* KISS (Keep It Simple Silly!)

Part of the Tech Team Lead's responsibility is doing code reviews, and
mentoring/teaching others.
